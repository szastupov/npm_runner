This package automatically discovers your project.json files, extracts scripts and puts them into a handy command palette, even if you have multiple projects.

## Installation

1. Download [latest release](https://github.com/szastupov/npm_runner/releases/latest)
2. Go to "Sublime menu, Preferences -> Browse Packages..." to open your packages folder
3. Unpack npm_runner archive into this folder
4. Done 👌

Someday you'll be able to install it from [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io) (see this [PR](https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel/pull/6086)).

## Usage

Just start typing "npm" from command palette, you'll figure out the rest.
