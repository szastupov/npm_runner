This package automatically discovers your project.json files, extracts scripts and puts them into a handy command palette, even if you have multiple projects.

## Installation

Soon you'll be able to install it from [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io) (see this [PR](https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel/pull/6086) ) but for now, just clone this repo into your packages folder.

## Usage

Just start typing "npm" from command palette, you'll figure out the rest.
